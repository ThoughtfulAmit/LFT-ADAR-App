With the partnership of Delhi Police, Leaders for Tomorrow, launched ADAR – Anti Drugs and Anti Ragging Campaign 2012 in all the major colleges of Delhi NCR.\n\nThe mission of LFT’s battle against drugs and ragging is to tell the youth that for a healthier life, they must respect themselves by staying away from drugs and respect others by staying away from any activity associated with ragging.Thus the campaign is titled ADAR (meaning respect in Hindi) to help the students associate with the cause.\n\nLast year, ADAR Campaign was bigger than ever as it was conducted in partnership with the Delhi Police. The police showed immense support by helping the volunteers take strict action in case of ragging and by providing valuable information on substance abuse and ragging.\n\n1500 volunteers from across 150 colleges set up Help Desks and did an active signature campaign in 200 colleges, thereby reaching out to nearly 5 lakh students directly in our movement towards social change. The 5 day Campaign was conducted 8 universities such as Delhi University GGSIP University, Private and Independent Universities including Amity University, Gautam Budh University, Delhi Technological University, Jaypee University etc." >
